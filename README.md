A hobby project making during the time I studied "The complete guide to Angular 5" in Udemy. The project is about making a website which we can see, delete, add or edit the recipes and shopping lists. 

## Technology

The project uses Angular 5 framework, bootstrap and HTML. This covers all the basic of Angular 5 including httpClient, Pipes, Directives, Angular Forms, Service, Routing, Ahead of Time Compilation and Animations.
